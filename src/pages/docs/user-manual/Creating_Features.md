This chapter aims to provide the reader with information and instructions for digitising new features in GPlates.

1 Digitisation
============

GPlates allows the user to create features on the globe: from aseismic ridges to volcanoes. To create a new feature, a user first "digitises" a new geometry, then specifies the additional properties for that feature. The geometries which GPlates handles are point, polyline (a series of lines drawn end-to-end, forming an open polygon) and polygon. Certain types of features require certain geometries, for example: a volcano uses a point to represent its position; an isochron uses a polyline to represent its center-line; and a basin uses a polygon to represent its outline.

1.1 Digitisation Tools
------------------

GPlates offers three digitisation tools in the **Tool Palette**:

<span style="display:inline-block; width:30px; vertical-align:middle;"><img src="icons/digitise_polyline_35.png" /> </span> Polyline Geometry

<span style="display:inline-block; width:30px; vertical-align:middle;"><img src="icons/digitise_multipoint_35.png" /> </span> Multi-point Geometries

<span style="display:inline-block; width:30px; vertical-align:middle;"><img src="icons/digitise_polygon_35.png" /> </span> Polygon Geometry

Each tool can be used to create any of the GPlates GPML features, however it is the userâ€™s responsibility to ensure that the correct geometry is digitised for the intended feature type.

After choosing a geometry tool, you can begin adding control points to the globe by clicking on an area; these points define the geometry (feature) you want to create. (You can still rotate the globe by holding down the `Ctrl` key.) After you have plotted the feature, the latitude and longitude can be verified in the digitisation panel.

Once you are satisfied with the new feature location, click **Create Feature** button to select the type of feature you would like to create. E.g Isochron, Fault, Mid Ocean Ridge etc.

The next step is to assign a **geometry property** to the feature as well as:

-   Plate ID

-   A begin time for the feature

-   An end time

-   A name (To help you distinguish/classify your feature)

Next you can choose to **add properties** to your new feature, or **edit existing properties**.

To Add available properties, you must select the property from the table (*e.g. gpml:age*), then click the **+ Add** button, where you are directed to the **Add/Edit Property** dialog, in which you can specify the features details.

In the final step of feature creation, the feature is assigned to a feature collection. All data files that are currently loaded in GPlates will be listed here, as well as the **&lt; New Feature Collection &gt;** option. Choosing any one of the existing feature collections and clicking **Create** will add the newly digitised feature to that collection and return the user to the GPlates main window.

If the **&lt; New Feature Collection &gt;** option is selected, a new feature collection will be created to hold the new feature. This feature collection will not yet have a name, and is not associated with a file on disk. Like all other feature collections, the new one will be found in the **Manage Feature Collections** dialog.
