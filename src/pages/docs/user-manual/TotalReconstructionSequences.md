Introduction
============

A Total Reconstruction Sequence (TRS) is a sequence of Total Reconstruction Poles (see [Reconsructions](/docs/user-manaul/Reconstructions/)) defining the motion of one plate with respect to another over time. GPlates regards a TRS as a feature; TRSs can be stored in feature collections, and imported and exported to file. A feature collection containing TRSs is known as a **reconstruction feature collection**. TRSs are imported to GPlates from a reconstruction file, which will typically contain TRSs relating to many different plates, and which will define the userâ€™s reconstruction model. At any given reconstruction time, GPlates analyses its collection of TRSs and generates Total Reconstruction Poles for the selected reconstruction time. These poles are then arranged into a Rotation Hierarchy (see [Reconstructions](/docs/user-manual/Reconstructions/#total-reconstruction-poles)) and used to position the plates.

The Total Reconstruction Sequences dialog
=========================================

The TRSs which have been loaded into GPlates can be viewed through the **Total Reconstruction Sequences** dialog which is accessed from the **Features** menu.

This tree display shows the reconstruction feature collections which are loaded, and the TRSs which they contain. Each TRS is summarised in the form **p1 rel p2 \[t1:t2\]** where **p1** and **p2** are plate ids, and **t1** and **t2** are times. For example **102 rel 101 \[0:245\]** indicates that the sequence describes the motion of plate 102 relative to plate 101 over the times 0 to 245 My.

Each sequence can be expanded to see the Total Reconstruction Poles which make up that sequence.

Editing a Total Reconstruction Sequence
=======================================

A TRS can be edited by selecting the sequence in the tree and clicking the **Edit Sequence** button. This opens the **Edit Total Reconstruction Sequence** dialog. After editing the TRS, select **Apply**, and the TRS dialog will be updated.

Creating a Total Reconstruction Sequence
========================================

A new TRS can be created by selecting **New Sequence**. After filling in the fields of the new sequence, including the moving and fixed plates, select **Next** and add the sequence to an existing feature collection, or create a new feature collection.

      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>

Disabling or Enabling a Total Reconstruction Sequence
==================================================

A Total Reconstruction sequence can be disabled at any time by pressing the **Disable sequence** button, which can than be enabled by pressing the **Enable sequence** button at any point thereafter. 

Sequences can also be deleted by clicking the **Delete Sequence** button.
